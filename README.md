This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Considerations made while building the app
Although tried my best to match the design layout, few considerations were made while building the app:
1. font sizes
2. font family
3. colors

## Possible add on features
In Desktop view, design shows vertical ellipsis as last column. It can be extended to open an action dropdown or menu items that displays the actions that can be taken for a particular row.
